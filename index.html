<p class="dashed">This wedsite is deticated to those who want the world to become unified through the practice of love. God teaches us that we need to love thy neighbor, which means to love everyone no matter what they look like, their gender, race, or sexual preference. Every single person is equal in God's eyes and its our generations time to show we can be humans that love deeply for each other and make a positive change not only in our country but in the world..</P>

With the situation with the current election going on and the news that Donald Trump, I'm sure there are others who are feeling the way I do right now. Yes I have strong republican views on most things and issues going on in our country but I also strongly believe that every human being deserves to live life the way they want and with whomever they want, no government should control who you can and can't love. I also hold strong feminist values that I try to fight for everyday but that doesn't mean it was my feminist duty to vote for a woman simply because she's a woman.
 
I'm very conflicted because yes I'm Glad our government is predominantly republican again and I believe we will restore this nation to be a Godly nation but that does not mean we should persecute those who choose not to believe in our God nor harm our brothers and sisters who love differently than we do. Yes, We are a nation under God BUT we are also the land of the free and every American no matter the race, gender, or sexual preference deserves to live freely.
So those who are feeling alone or betrayed by their neighbors, know not all republicans or those who voted for trump are against your rights and we will continue to fight for your rights as Americans.</p>
